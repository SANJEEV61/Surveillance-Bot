- ## Project Description ‚ùó
  The yearly occurrence of unnecessary accidents is a result of bad techniques of construction, no maintenance and repair, various organizations taking charge with unclear responsibilities and bureaucratic 
  indifference. Thousands of politicians vow every year to make road maintenance the priority. However, barely any action is taken. The primary cause of poor maintenance is the manual effort required to repair 
  and clean the roads.
  This project aims at completely automating the road maintenance by constructing a fully functioning robot called PristineProBot. This is a self-driving vehicle intelligently curated to detect any malfunctioning 
  roads and repair them instantaneously. An extensive literature survey conducted revealed that the existing research is limited to only pothole detection but there is no mention of the fixing of the roads or the 
  cleaning process. This project overcomes all the limitations of the existing research to build an advanced robot with several features such as detection of roads that are not levelled, repairing the roads to be 
  levelled, storage of details of blocked roads via its built-in camera and notifying the users of blocked road conditions. These features ensure crystal clear, well-maintained roads. The authority can run this 
  self-driving robot periodically around the city to automatically maintain clean and levelled roads.

- ## Features üòç
 This robot detects ANY PROBLEM on the road and resolves it by levelling the road. Every Sunday (7th day of the week or any frequency required), the robot automatically surveys each and every road of a city to 
 detect ABNORMAL, PROBLEMATIC roads. This robot can contribute to Swach Bharath because it also detects any garbage or dust piles present on the road and cleans it as and when! It is completely self-driving so no 
 manual intervention is required. Built-in camera that stores images of ALL roads with problems so that a traveler gets to know instantly if there is any damage to the road. In case the authority like BBMP just 
 wants to detect problems and resolve it later, it sends a message to the authority with the exact Google maps location so that the BBMP can record the problems and resolve it at a later time. It records the 
 ABNORMAL, PROBLEMATIC roads in the database (Memory card) the list of all roads that are damaged.
