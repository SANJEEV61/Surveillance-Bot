- ## Project Description ❗
The yearly occurrence of unnecessary accidents is a result of bad techniques of construction, no maintenance and repair, various organizations taking charge with unclear responsibilities and bureaucratic indifference. Thousands of politicians vow every year to make road maintenance the priority. However, barely any action is taken. The primary cause of poor maintenance is the manual effort required to repair and clean the roads.
This project aims at completely automating the road maintenance by constructing a fully functioning robot called PristineProBot. This is a self-driving vehicle intelligently curated to detect any malfunctioning roads and repair them instantaneously. An extensive literature survey conducted revealed that the existing research is limited to only pothole detection but there is no mention of the fixing of the roads or the cleaning process. This project overcomes all the limitations of the existing research to build an advanced robot with several features such as detection of roads that are not levelled, repairing the roads to be levelled, storage of details of blocked roads via its built-in camera and notifying the users of blocked road conditions. These features ensure crystal clear, well-maintained roads. The authority can run this self-driving robot periodically around the city to automatically maintain clean and levelled roads.
